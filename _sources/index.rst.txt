pyradiosky
==========

|image0| |codecov|

Python objects and interfaces for representing diffuse, extended and
compact astrophysical radio sources.

pyradiosky is currently in a very early development stage, interfaces
are changing rapidly.

The primary user class is ``SkyModel``, which supports: - catalogs of
point sources (read/write to text files, read VOTables) - diffuse models
as HEALPix maps (read/write to hd5 format) - conversion between RA/Dec
and Azimuth/Elevation including calculating full polarization
coherencies in Az/El.

Community Guidelines
--------------------

Contributions to this package to add new file formats or address any of
the issues in the `issue
log <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyradiosky/issues>`__
are very welcome, as are bug reports and feature requests. Please see
our `guide on contributing <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyradiosky/tree/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

Versioning
----------

We have not yet decided on a definitive versioning approach. We track
all changes in our
`changelog <https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyradiosky/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Documentation
-------------

Developer API documentation is hosted
`here <https://radioastronomysoftwaregroup.github.io/pyradiosky/>`__.

Installation
------------

Simple installation via pip is available for users, developers should
follow the directions under `Developer
Installation <#developer-installation>`__ below.

A user-installation is achieved simply with ``pip install pyradiosky``,
or to get the bleeding-edge:
``pip install https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyradiosky``.

If you wish to work with HEALPix maps, you will need additional
dependencies (i.e.Â astropy-healpix) installed, in that case install
``pyradiosky`` with ``pip install pyradiosky[healpix]``

If you wish to manage dependencies manually read on.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using ``conda`` to manage your environment, you may wish to
install the following packages before installing ``pyradiosky``:

Required:

-  astropy>=4.0
-  h5py
-  numpy>=1.15
-  scipy>1.0.1
-  pyuvdata
-  setuptools_scm

Optional:

-  astropy-healpix

Developer Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are developing ``pyradiosky``, you will need to download and
install the repository using
``git clone https://github.com/RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup/pyradiosky.git``.

If you use conda, you may wish to use a fresh environment, in which case
you can use the included ``environment.yaml`` file to make a conda
environment with all the extra dependencies required for
testing/development as well as the standard ones using
``conda env create -f environment.yml``. If you do not wish to make a
fresh dedicated environment, you should verify that the environment you
are using contains the packages listed in that file. Then do a developer
install of pyradiosky using ``pip install -e .`` (or
``pip install --no-deps -e .`` if you do not want pip to install any
missing requirements).

If you do not use conda, after downloading the repository, install using
``pip install -e .[dev]`` to install all the extra dependencies required
for testing/development as well as the standard ones.

Finally, install the pre-commit hook using ``pre-commit install`` to
help prevent committing code that does not meet our style guidelines.

Tests
-----

Uses the ``pytest`` package to execute test suite. From the source
pyradiosky directory run ``pytest`` or ``python -m pytest``.
